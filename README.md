</div>

## Purpose

I built this extension to replace my browser's new tab page because the one I was using before was closed source and felt a bit sketchy. Plus, it used way more resources than I liked. Making my own version let me customize everything exactly how I want it. Keeping it open source was super important to me because I want to trust the tools I use every day.
